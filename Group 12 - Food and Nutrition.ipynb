It is also present in animal-based foods. Cholesterol supports many essential bodily functions, but high levels can lead to health issues. **[2]** The majority of individuals are unaware that cholesterol found in food is not the same as cholesterol that clogs arteries. To be sure, high-cholesterol diets can raise cholesterol levels in the blood.The amount of cholesterol you eat from food is determined by the combination of fats, carbohydrates and other nutrients in your diet. **[3]** If a person has heart disease risk factors, that person should limit cholesterol consumption to no more than 200 milligrams per day otherwise they should limit cholesterol intake to no more than 300 milligrams per day. **[4]** However, fats present in plant products like olive oil, many seeds and nuts, and some seafood, on the other hand, have the capacity to lower blood cholesterol. **[5]** When compared to their inactive peers, some elderly endurance athletes had significantly greater HDL cholesterol levels and lower TC/HDL cholesterol ratios. For older men who exercise frequently, this good plasma lipoprotein profile may imply a lower risk of coronary artery disease. **[6]** There are some products like cheese, goat liver and shellfish with high cholesterol levels that are healthy but over consumption may cause health issues. **[7]** Foods like red meat, processed meat, egg yolk and alcohol tend to have high cholesterol levels. **[1]** Everyone can lower cholesterol naturally without medication by consuming more monounsaturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and more soluble fiber. **[8]** From a study, it showed that low-carb diet helps in lowering the cholesterol levels. Low-carb diets limit the number of carbohydrates a person eats. Instead of carbs, people focus on eating proteins, healthful fats, and vegetables. **[9]** On the keto diet, each day you’re eating up to 80 percent of your calories from fat and sticking with 20 to 50 grams of net carbs, a term used in popular diets, including keto. This will have negative impact on cholesterol if they consume more unsaturated fats because of keto diet. **[10]** Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the \"bad\" cholesterol, transports cholesterol particles throughout your body. LDL cholesterol builds up in the walls of your arteries, making them hard and narrow. High-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL, the \"good\" cholesterol, picks up excess cholesterol and takes it back to your liver."],"metadata":{"id":"6imF4tCjsfDA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Bj-e5pHmLx6c"},"source":["## Unique values from `Category` (3 pts, 1 pt each)\n","* Count how many unique values are in `df['Category']`\n","* Make a frequency table of how many entries exist per `df['Category']`.
